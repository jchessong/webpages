    <p style= font-family: Times; font-size: 16px; Color: #FFFFFF; >
    My name is Juliette Hessong, I am a <em>freshman</em> and North Carolina State University. 
    I am planning on majoring in <strong>Civil Engineering</strong>.  I chose this major as I took 
    inspiration from my <ins>grandfather</ins> who was a civil engineer.  </p>    
    
    <p> My dream job is to be a forensic engineer.  I would love to have the opportunity
    to improve urban infrastructure and make a difference.  I have looked at a couple
    companies but I am not sure where I want to live, so I am not sure which one I want 
    to end up working for!</p>
